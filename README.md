# Identifying-special-matrices
This function will test if a 4×4 matrix is singular, i.e. to determine if an inverse exists, before calculating it
In this method, we begin with converting a matrix to echelon form, and testing if this fails by leaving zeros that can’t be removed on the leading diagonal.
